# InnoCine ðŸŽ¬ â€“ Family-Friendly Movie Recommender  

InnoCine is a movie recommender app designed to help families enjoy great films without unexpected awkward moments. 
As movie lovers, we often watch together as a family, but encountering sexual or nudity scenes can make things uncomfortable and awkward. 
That's why I built **InnoCine**!  

## ðŸŽ¯ Features  
- âœ… Recommends only highly rated movies (7+ on IMDb)  
- âœ… Optional filter to exclude films with sexual or nudity content  
- âœ… Simple and user-friendly interface  

## ðŸš€ How It Works  
InnoCine recommends movies based on the genre you select.  
Just tick the checkbox to filter out movies with sexual/nudity scenes, and enjoy stress-free family movie nights!
